# Next.js E-Commerce App
- This web app is built using Next.js 14 (App Router), TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Prisma, DaisyUI etc.
- It provides a login option via Google accounts using the NextAuth authentication system.
- This e-commerce app's cart system is designed similarly to Amazon's. A visitor can add items to their cart without logging in. Upon subsequent logins, these items will be added to any existing carts from their previous login session. If no cart exists at the time of login, a new cart will be created with these items under the user's name.
- This platform features pagination for browsing products and a search function that allows users to find products based on their name or description.
